# June 12: Learning Keyboard Schematics and Core functionality

Today I was thinking of getting started on the schematic but then realized that It wont be as easy as making a macropad. So I had to learn about switch matrix and how to efficiently use GPIO pins on the MCU to maximize the utility and how to properly make the schematic for a mechanical keyboard and what parts I should choose based on the requirements and the wants of my keyboards(Rotary Encoder and Oled Display). I watched a couple of youtube videos to learn about it and I also learnt about some cool plugins(e.g key switch plugin) I can use in KiCad to make it easier to design the schematic and make the process faster

After learning about the schematics, I started making a list of things that I want in my keyboard and the things I have will need to make it happen. Check out the Link to see the core functionality of my keyboard and what parts I will be using.

Tomorrow I will get started on the schematic and hopefully finish!
